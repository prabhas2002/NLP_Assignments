# Introduction to NLP Assignments

This repository contains all the solved assignments of the Introduction to NLP course (DS 207) offered at IISc Bangalore for the academic year 2024. To know more about the assignments, check out [Intro to NLP Jan 2024](https://github.com/FLAIR-IISc/Intro-to-NLP-Jan-2024).

## Assignments Overview

1. **Assignment 1**: The task is to write and train a skip-gram model from scratch. The model's performance is evaluated by comparing its output with Google's vectors on various analogies.

2. **Assignment 2**: This assignment focuses on Language Modelling. N-grams, Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are implemented from scratch for this purpose.

3. **Assignment 3**: This assignment focuses on character-level translation from English to Hindi. Given any English name, the model should translate it to Hindi. Two variations are implemented: one using an RNN and the other using an RNN with attention.
