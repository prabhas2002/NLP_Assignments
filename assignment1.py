# Assignment 1

**DS: 207 Introduction to Natural Language Processing**

**Due (Feb 6, 16:59 PM)**

Development & Design: Debarpan Bhattacharya & Nicy Scaria.

Testing: Kinshuk Vasisht

The goal of this assignment is introduce the basics of text processing, by building a few text classifiers, and learning to represent words.

You'll have to add your code wherever you see the comment `# ADD YOUR CODE HERE`. Please make a copy of this assignment, and you can use Google Colab notebooks to work on this. Later, you can download this notebook as a python file and submit it as per the following instructions.

## Submission Instructions:

1. In the notebook, a few example codes are provided, whereas a few are kept blank for you to fill them up.
2. The evaluation will be based on the results obtained by functions impleted by you. Do not change the print statements having `EVALUATION` as they are used for auto-evaluation.
3. **Submission file(s)**:
  
  * Save this `.ipynb` to your drive, complete the required code blocks and run the notebook.
  * After completing this assignment, download the notebook as`.py`. Name it as `SAPname_SRno_assignment1.py`, where `SAPname` refers to your name as per SAP record, and `SRno` refers to the last 5 digits of your IISc SR number. For example, IISc student with SAP name Twyla Linda (SR no - 04-03-00-10-22-20-1-15329) would name it as `Twyla_Linda_15329_assignment1.py`.
  *   The files associated with the Word2Vec training, i.e., the `model.pt`, `vocab.pt`, `word_embeddings.npy` and `loss.json`, will be downloaded and saved in a folder with the name `SAPname_SRno`. Zip this folder along with the `.py` file, save it as `SAPname_SRno_assigment1` and upload on MS Teams. The zip folder should contain: (1) `SAPname_SRno_assignment1.py`, (2) a subfolder called `SAPname_SRno` which will contain `model.pt`, `vocab.pt` , `word_embeddings.npy` and `loss.json`.


Because submissions are auto-graded, please ensure that the naming of the files is consistent with the instructions.

## Part I Text Classification (TA: Debarpan Bhattacharya)

**Dataset**:

We will dive into a basic text-based sentiment classification task. The dataset consists of sentences with two different kinds of sentiments- `positive`, and `negative` sentiments. Following are a set of examples,

* **`positive`**: *I really like your new haircut!*
* **`negative`**: *Your new haircut is awful!*

The Dataset has a training set (`train_data.csv`- provided), a validation set (`val_data.csv`- provided) and a blind test set (`test_data.csv`- not provided). The notebook uses a `test_data.csv` file, but it is just a duplicate of `val_data.csv`, and the blind `test_data.csv` will replace it while grading your solutions.

**Important**: Fix seed as 42 whenever performing any randomized operations, e.g., initializing ML models.

"""#### Approach 1: Rule based classification

The rule-based classification works using a few hand-crafted rules. In sentiment classification, few words are associated with positive sentiment and few others with negative sentiment. Let's attempt to build a classifier that predicts the sentiment of the reviews based on such words.

Let's first write a few rules to extract important features about the input movie review. As an example, we provide a function that counts the number of `good` and `bad` words in the input.

Below, you can see a sample rule-based classification system. Later, you will be building one yourself.

Word2vec is one of the most popular techniques to learn word embeddings. The idea behind word2vec was that the meaning of a word is determined by the context in which it occurs. A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation.

**Word2vec** model has 2 architectures:

1. **Continuous bag of word (CBOW):**

    CBOW predicts the center word from the surrounding context words.

2. **Skip-gram:**

    Skip-gram predicts surrounding context words from the center word.

#### SkipGram from Scratch

In this exercise, you will code the skipgram model from scratch using the PyTorch library.
